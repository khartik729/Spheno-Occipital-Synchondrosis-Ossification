The fusion of occipital bone and sphenoid bone at the spheno-occipital synchondrosis (SOS) has been shown to correspond to skeletal age based on the degree of fusion that has occurred and can be assessed through cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) studies. Our study uses a newly proposed 5-stage classification in addition to the AI-based modified Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for the automation of tasks.
